# GUI-Project
A GUI I created during my 2019 coop at the Biomedical Optics Research Group

With this GUI, the user will be able to analyze a retinal volume associated with the en face angiography. The retinal volume is a three-dimensional scan consisting of the cross-section (B-scan) of the retina. In the GUI, there will be 3 windows, 2 for the en face images and 1 window for cross-sectional view (B-scan) of the volume.

The GUI begins by asking the user to select the scan size then load 2 images and a volumetric scan taken from the PLEX Elite 9000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). The scan is 375 MB, therefore I have attached a screenshot of the GUI in action (GUIpic.png). Once the files are loaded, there will be lines on the 3 images. The horizontal green line controls which B-scan the user can view in the bottom right window. The user can also draw on the en face and the area of the drawn regions would be given. The user can then save the drawn regions and areas onto a MAT file to later load and continue their work.
